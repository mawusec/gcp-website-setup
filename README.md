Technologies Used
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): For cloud infrastructure and services
Drupal: Content Management System (CMS) for building and managing the website
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): For networking and security
SEO Tools: For optimizing the website's performance in search engines
Prerequisites
Before starting with this setup, ensure that you have the following:

A Google Cloud Platform account
A registered domain (if you are transferring an existing one)
Basic knowledge of Google Cloud services and Drupal CMS
Familiarity with command-line tools (GCP CLI, SSH)
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your secure, SEO-friendly website up and running:

1. Domain Transfer to GCP
Transferring your domain to GCP simplifies domain management and integrates it seamlessly with other Google services.

Log in to the Google Domains interface.
Choose the option to transfer your domain from your existing registrar.
Update your DNS settings to point to your GCP instance.
2. Setting Up VPC
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ensures that your website is securely isolated within your own virtual network. Follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to VPC Network > Create VPC.
Choose the default subnet mode and configure any additional settings for your network.
Set up firewall rules to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic while securing internal services.
Enable private Google access for further security.
3. Deploying Drupal CMS
With Drupal, you can easily manage your websiteâ€™s content and optimize it for SEO. To deploy Drupal:

Go to the Google Cloud Marketplace.
Search for Drupal and select the official Drupal image.
Click Launch to deploy the Drupal CMS to your GCP project.
Configure the database (either using Google Cloud SQL or another service of your choice).
Access your Drupal site to begin content creation.
SEO Optimization Tips
To ensure your Drupal website is SEO-friendly, follow these best practices:

Enable URL Aliases: Use clean, descriptive URLs for your pages and content.
Install SEO Modules: Install the "SEO Checklist" and "Metatag" modules in Drupal for improved SEO management.
Create Quality Content: Regularly update the site with high-quality content that answers users' queries.
Use SSL/TLS: Ensure the website is served over HTTPS for security and SEO ranking.
Optimize Images: Compress images to improve loading times and site performance.
